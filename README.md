Code for a minecraft plugin, if you wish to help just try to make my code more efficient lol ;-;

Hello!
Name's Nikarion or ThatCatNik, i'm a guy who loves coding and videogames. This repository holds all the code i've made for my minecraft spigot plugin. Being self-taught (AKA playing around with the code or watching youtube videos), the code is bound to be weird/inefficient, so if you wish to help, i'd be happy! You can also suggest ideas if you like.
